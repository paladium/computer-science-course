# API
API is very similar to regular websites, however instead of getting rendered page in HTML, you are getting a JSON response which you can use in your application and extend its functionality.

For example, you can use coinmarket API to view the latest price for Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.

Or you can use the Weather API to get the weather in your current city.
