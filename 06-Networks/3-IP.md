### IP addressing
IP addresses consists of 4 "octets" such as: 171.64.20.23
Each "octet" consists of numbers between 0 and 255
It works sort of like the phone system, with "area codes" to the left, then "prefix" etc. but more flexible. On university campus, your computer will know that "171.64." means "Stanford" while it will figure out that "20" means "Pine Hall" and will learn that "23" means the computer called "networking."
