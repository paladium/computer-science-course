# Homework
Make a simple astronomer guide website. It should have 5 pages:

## Home page
It will show the list of planets that you can get more information about, each planet should have a name and the link that opens the web page for that planet.

## Planet pages
4 pages in total - one for each planet. Each of the page should contain the title (h1 tag) name of the planet, 2-3 images of the planet, description of the planet and finally the list of its properties, like the following:
- Surface Temperature: 45Â°C
- Atmosphere: 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.1 percent other gases
- Life: Yes
- Distance from Sun: 150 billion km

You can add as many properties of the planets, the more the better.

Finally the planet's page, should have a link at the bottom which when clicked will go to the home page.

## Notes
Submit the assignment as a github repository. Have the main file (home page) named index.html and each of the planets pages should be located in the folder named planets/, like the following:
- planets/earth.html
- planets/mars.html
...
Finally, add a simple README.md file to the root of your repository and describe the purpose of the project. Use the folllowing guide to learn more about the markdown: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/
