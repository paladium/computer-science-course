# Simple python web server
The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate how we can create a simple python web server.

This server, will simply serve the local file and since we called it the ```index.html```, it will opened automatically. 

This is how you can start the web server in the current directory:
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```
Now, you can open the browser and type: localhost:8080 or 127.0.0.1:8080.
