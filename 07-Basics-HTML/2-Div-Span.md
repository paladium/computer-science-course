# Div element
Div element is usually used to group multiple elements together, it takes the full width of the page (could be changed as well). Div is a block element.

```html
<div>
    <p>Hello world</p>
    <p>Hi Earth</p>
</div>
```

## Span element
Span element on the other hand is a inline element, meaning it only takes as much space as needed for the content. It is especially useful when you want to display multiple elements on the same line:
```html
<span>Hello</span>
<span>My address is</span>
```
