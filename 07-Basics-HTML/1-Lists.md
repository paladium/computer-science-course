# Lists in HTML
HTML has two main types of lists:
- Ordered
- Unordered

The only difference is how they are displayed the user and their meaning.

## Ordered List
You need to use the ```ol``` tag which means ordered list and put each element in ```li``` tag.
```html
<ol>
    <li>Item</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```
This will display the following list
1. Item
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Unordered list
The only difference is you need to use the ```ul``` tag unstead of ```ol``` tag:
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
This will display the following list:
- Item
- Item 2
- Item 3
