# Web Server in Python

Web apps are developed to generate content based on retrieved data that changes based on a user’s interaction with the site, where the server is responsible for querying, retrieving, and updating data. This makes web applications to be slower and more complicated to deploy than static websites for simple applications. There are two primary coding environments for the whole web app ecosystem.


**Client-side scripting** – The code executed on the user’s browser visible to anyone who has access to the system, generating the first results.

**Server-side scripting** – This type of code is run on the backend on a web server. To enable developers to design, build, maintain, host web apps over the internet, a web framework is required.

## Framework

A web framework is an architecture containing tools, libraries, and functionalities suitable to build and maintain massive web projects using a fast and efficient approach. They are designed to streamline programs and promote code reuse. To create the server-side of the web application, you need to use a server-side language. Python is home to numerous such frameworks, famous among which are Django and Flask

We will be using a Flask framework. This framework provides you will all the nessesary tools to create both simple and complex web servers - work with html.
